# RPG Loot Drop Generator
This Python tool has two main features: 1) the customizable loot drop chart with 100 rows on the left side of the screen, and a simple random number generator that generates 12 pieces of loot per click.

## To Use
* Fill in the chart with 100 pieces of loot.

This list will be saved when you close the app, so you can reuse it again and again.

* Click the button in the middle marked "Generate Loot"

It's that simple!
